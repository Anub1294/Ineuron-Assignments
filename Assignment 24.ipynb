    "#\tLambda expressions (also known as lambda functions) are anonymous functions that can be defined using the lambda keyword. They are often used for simple operations and can be defined in a single line.\n"

    "#\tReadability: Lambda expressions can make the code more readable when the operation being performed is straightforward and doesn't require a separate function definition.\n",
