    "#\tWhen we use square brackets ([ ]), we create a list comprehension. It generates a new list by applying an expression to each item in the iterable.\n",
    "#\tWhen we use parentheses (( )), we create a generator expression. It generates an iterator that produces values on-the-fly as you iterate through it. This is memory-efficient compared to creating a full list in memory.\n"

    "#Q5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "Ans. It is as follows:\n",
    "Relationship:\n",
    "\tMap: The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (or multiple iterables) and returns an iterator that produces the results.\n",
    "\tList Comprehension: A list comprehension creates a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable and collecting the results in a single list.\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "\tBoth map and list comprehensions are used to transform data based on a given operation.\n",
    "\tmap tends to be more concise and memory-efficient for simple operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\tList comprehensions are more versatile as they can include conditionals and nested operations, making them more powerful for complex transformations.\n",
    "Contrast:\n",
    "\tList comprehensions are more expressive and allow for complex conditions and nested operations.\n",
    "\tmap is particularly useful when you want to apply a single function to multiple iterables in parallel.\n",
    "\tList comprehensions create a new list immediately, while map returns an iterator, which can be memory-efficient for large datasets.\n"
